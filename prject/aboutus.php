        <p>
            Over the last 20 years, technology has changed. The way people communicate has changed. But one thing that remains the same is eharmony’s mission: to create meaningful connections which lead to long-term love. It all started in 1997. After 35 years practicing as a clinical psychologist and counseling thousands of couples, eharmony founder Dr. Neil Clark Warren came to believe there had to be a better way to put two people together for relationship success.

        <p>
            From his vast experience, he found that the best relationships involved two highly compatible people. That theory was confirmed following intense scientific research, resulting in eharmony’s famed 29 dimensions of compatibility, which fuel the algorithms behind our patented Compatibility Matching System®.

            We could say mission accomplished, but would rather say mission in progress, as we hope to continue matching those seeking long-term love for many years to come. Up next? A groundbreaking overhaul of the eharmony you know and trust, making your search for a great relationship easier than ever.
